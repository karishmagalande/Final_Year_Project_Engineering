Image Captioning for Assistive Vision

The Assistive Vision Caption Bot is an AI-powered system designed to help individuals with visual impairments understand their surroundings through automatic image captioning and text-to-speech functionality. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning models, the bot generates accurate and meaningful descriptions for images and converts them into speech, enabling users to receive auditory feedback on visual content.
